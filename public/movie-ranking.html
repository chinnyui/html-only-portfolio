<h1>Chinny's Top 3 Movies</h1>
<h2>The best movies (or ones I'm just super excited for) of all time according to me!</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Cinderella</h3>
<p>I mean the live action Cinderella with Lily James, Robert Madden and Cate Blanchett. There isn't a single film that Cate Blanchett isn't amazing in, and I loved the blue dress that Lily James's Cinderella wore. I also loved how they built the relationship between Cinderella and the Prince, as well as how they showed some of his relationship with the King. And it was funny too. Always a plus.</p>
<h3>The Little Mermaid</h3>
<p>Halle is an amazing singer and I can't wait to see her act in the Little Mermaid! I want to see how they've adapted it to live action - apparently it was on par with the live action Cinderella</p>
<h3>Barbie</h3>
<p>This is being released in July. I have seen both trailers and it looks amazing. I am going to learn to skate and dress all in pink to go to the cinema. I can't wait.</p>
